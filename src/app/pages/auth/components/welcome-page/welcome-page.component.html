              Note that the "Available Online" and final date of publication may often be very different, but except in rare cases it is "Available Online" that you should care about because that is when people begin to be able to get your paper. However, some journals do not do all of the final proof correction until closer to the date of publication, but essentially just have your preprint up online for quite some time!
